## `about this project`

This project was built with API data of my brothers personal website https://vitrazai.lt/ (he wants a new one anyway, so this is WIP version). I was actualy quite happy that it coincided with this homework task since the effort will not be lost like most homeworks are, and I will refactor it later, make it propper depending on what we will decide to do with it.
